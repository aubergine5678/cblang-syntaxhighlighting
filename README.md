# cbLang Syntax Highlighting for VS Code

This is a very simple extension to add basic syntax highlighting for the revolutionary [cbLang programming language](https://github.com/Ceebox/cbLang) in VS Code! Pretty colours for your keywords, operators, functions... What more could you want?! This is a **must-have** extension for any cbLang developer!


## DISCLAIMER

I made this in about an hour, having never made an extension for VS Code before, so it is not perfect. Far from it, in fact! This was mostly done as a fun experiment - I may or may not continue working on this in the future... who knows `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Expect bugs and for this extension to not support *ALL* of `cbLang`'s *amazing* features.

With that said, **ENJOY!**
